## Key Enhancements

### 1. Advanced Feature Engineering (19 Features)

#### Original Features (11)
- `price_momentum`: Overall price change rate
- `price_acceleration`: Rate of change of momentum
- `volatility`: Standard deviation of returns
- `volatility_trend`: Recent vs historical volatility
- `volume_trend`: Current vs average volume
- `atr`: Average True Range (volatility measure)
- `ma_cross_5_10`: 5-period vs 10-period MA crossover
- `ma_cross_10_20`: 10-period vs 20-period MA crossover
- `price_vs_mean`: Price deviation from mean (z-score)
- `price_vs_high`: Distance from recent high
- `price_vs_low`: Distance from recent low

#### New Advanced Features (8)
- `support_level`: 10th percentile of recent lows (key support)
- `resistance_level`: 90th percentile of recent highs (key resistance)
- `price_to_support`: Distance to support level
- `price_to_resistance`: Distance to resistance level
- `ma_alignment`: Whether MAs are aligned (1=bullish, -1=bearish, 0=mixed)
- `trend_consistency`: Percentage of up candles in recent period
- `vol_clustering`: Volatility clustering indicator (GARCH-like)
- `volume_momentum`: Volume z-score (high/low relative to recent)

### 2. Six Advanced Models

#### Model 1: Momentum Model (Original)
**Purpose:** Detect trend direction and strength  
**Inputs:** price_momentum, price_acceleration  
**Output:** -1 (bearish) to +1 (bullish)  
**Logic:** Combines momentum and acceleration with hyperbolic tangent scaling

#### Model 2: Volatility Model (Original)
**Purpose:** Adapt to volatility conditions  
**Inputs:** volatility_trend, volume_trend, price_momentum  
**Output:** -1 to +1  
**Logic:** 
- High vol + high volume → strong directional signal
- Low vol → consolidation (neutral signal)

#### Model 3: MA Crossover Model (Original)
**Purpose:** Detect trend changes  
**Inputs:** ma_cross_5_10, ma_cross_10_20  
**Output:** -1 to +1  
**Logic:** Short MAs above long MAs = bullish, below = bearish

#### Model 4: Mean Reversion Model (Original)
**Purpose:** Identify extreme price deviations  
**Inputs:** price_vs_mean  
**Output:** -1 to +1  
**Logic:** Extreme deviations (>2σ) suggest mean reversion

#### Model 5: Trend Strength Model (NEW)
**Purpose:** Analyze trend alignment and consistency  
**Inputs:** ma_alignment, trend_consistency, price_momentum  
**Output:** -1 (strong downtrend) to +1 (strong uptrend)  
**Logic:**
- All MAs aligned + high consistency → strong trend signal
- Mixed alignment or low consistency → weak/neutral signal
- Enhances signal strength in clear trends

#### Model 6: Support/Resistance Model (NEW)
**Purpose:** Detect bounces and rejections at key levels  
**Inputs:** price_to_support, price_to_resistance, volume_momentum  
**Output:** -1 to +1  
**Logic:**
- Near support + high volume → bullish bounce
- Near resistance + high volume → bearish rejection
- Mid-range → proportional signal based on position

### 3. Market Regime Detection

The system automatically detects three market regimes:

#### Trending Markets
**Conditions:**
- Strong MA alignment (all aligned)
- High trend consistency (>65% or <35%)
- Moderate volatility

**Trading Adjustments:**
- Lower signal thresholds (easier to trigger)
- Amplify signal strength (×1.1)
- More aggressive positioning

#### Ranging Markets
**Conditions:**
- No MA alignment
- Moderate trend consistency (35-65%)
- Low to moderate volatility

**Trading Adjustments:**
- Normal signal thresholds
- Standard signal strength
- Balanced positioning

#### Volatile Markets
**Conditions:**
- High volatility clustering (>1.5x)
- High absolute volatility (>5%)
- Erratic price action

**Trading Adjustments:**
- Higher signal thresholds (×1.3)
- Dampen signal strength (×0.8)
- More conservative positioning

---

### 4. Adaptive Model Weighting

The system learns which models perform better and adjusts their influence:

#### Performance Tracking
Each model tracks:
- Total predictions made
- Correct predictions
- Accuracy rate
- Dynamic weight

#### Weight Calculation
```python
accuracy = correct_predictions / total_predictions
weight = exp(accuracy - 0.5)  # if total >= 10 predictions
```

**Examples:**
- 50% accuracy → weight = 1.0 (neutral)
- 70% accuracy → weight = 1.22 (higher influence)
- 90% accuracy → weight = 1.49 (much higher influence)
- 30% accuracy → weight = 0.82 (lower influence)

#### Weighted Ensemble
Final signal = (Σ model_score × model_weight) / (Σ model_weight)

This gives better-performing models more influence on final decisions.

---

### 5. Enhanced Confidence Scoring

Confidence combines multiple factors:

#### Base Confidence
- **Model Agreement:** Low standard deviation of scores = high confidence
- Formula: `1 - min(std_dev, 1)`

#### Volatility Adjustment
- **High Volatility:** Reduces confidence (less predictable)
- Formula: `1 - min(vol_clustering / 2.0, 0.3)`

#### Trend Clarity Bonus
- **Clear Trends:** Increases confidence
- Formula: `abs(ma_alignment) * 0.2`

#### Final Confidence
```python
confidence = base_confidence × vol_adjustment + trend_clarity
confidence = clamp(confidence, 0, 1)
```

---

### 6. Risk-Adjusted Signal Filtering

Signals are filtered based on market conditions:

#### Volatile Markets
- Signal threshold: ×1.3 (require stronger signals)
- Signal strength: ×0.8 (dampen signals)
- Extra caution: ×1.2 if vol_clustering > 2.0

#### Trending Markets
- Signal threshold: ×0.9 (easier to trigger)
- Signal strength: ×1.1 (amplify signals)
- More aggressive trading

#### Ranging Markets
- Signal threshold: ×1.0 (standard)
- Signal strength: ×1.0 (standard)
- Balanced approach

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```python
from ml_signals import MLSignalGenerator

# Initialize
ml_gen = MLSignalGenerator(lookback_period=50, signal_threshold=0.6)

# Generate signal
signal = ml_gen.generate_ml_signal(klines_data, current_price)

# Access results
print(f"Action: {signal['action']}")  # buy, sell, or hold
print(f"Strength: {signal['strength']}")  # 0-100
print(f"Confidence: {signal['indicators']['ml_confidence']:.1f}%")
print(f"Market Regime: {ml_gen.market_regime}")
```

### Adaptive Learning
```python
# After a trade completes, update model performance
# If the signal was correct:
ml_gen.update_model_performance('momentum', was_correct=True)
ml_gen.update_model_performance('trend_strength', was_correct=True)

# If the signal was incorrect:
ml_gen.update_model_performance('volatility', was_correct=False)

# Weights automatically adjust after 10+ predictions per model
```

### Accessing Features
```python
features = ml_gen.extract_features(klines_data, current_price)

print(f"Support: ${features['support_level']:.4f}")
print(f"Resistance: ${features['resistance_level']:.4f}")
print(f"Trend Consistency: {features['trend_consistency']:.1%}")
print(f"Vol Clustering: {features['vol_clustering']:.2f}")
```

USE_ML_SIGNALS=true
```

---

## Monitoring

### Check Regime Detection
```python
print(f"Current Regime: {ml_gen.market_regime}")
# Output: 'trending', 'ranging', or 'volatile'
```

### Monitor Model Performance
```python
for model, perf in ml_gen.model_performance.items():
    if perf['total'] > 0:
        accuracy = perf['correct'] / perf['total']
        print(f"{model}: {accuracy:.1%} accuracy, weight={perf['weight']:.2f}")
```

### Signal Breakdown
Signals now include regime information:
```
ML Ensemble: Momentum: 0.58, Trend: 0.80, Regime: trending
```

---

## Technical Details

### Computational Complexity
- **Feature Extraction:** O(n) where n = lookback_period
- **Model Ensemble:** O(1) - fixed number of models
- **Overall:** Still very fast, typically <10ms per signal

### Memory Usage
- **Feature History:** Limited to last 1000 predictions
- **Regime History:** Limited to last 100 detections
- **Performance Tracking:** Minimal (6 models × 4 metrics)

### Stability
- All calculations include epsilon terms to prevent division by zero
- Hyperbolic tangent (tanh) prevents extreme values
- Clamping ensures values stay in expected ranges

## Future Enhancements

Potential additions for v3.0:
1. **Order Flow Analysis:** Track bid/ask imbalances
2. **Market Depth Integration:** Analyze order book levels
3. **Correlation Analysis:** Multi-asset relationships
4. **Sentiment Analysis:** News/social media signals
5. **Real ML Models:** Replace rule-based with trained neural networks

---

## Troubleshooting

### Signals Too Conservative
- Check market regime (may be 'volatile')
- Verify model performance (weights may be low)
- Consider lowering signal_threshold parameter

### Not Adapting to Performance
- Ensure update_model_performance is called after trades
- Need at least 10 predictions per model for weight adjustment
- Check logs for model accuracy updates

### Unexpected Regime Detection
- Review recent market data (high volatility?)
- Check vol_clustering value (>1.5 = volatile)
- Verify trend_consistency (extremes = trending)
