# Changelog

All notable changes to the XRP Hedge Bot project will be documented in this file.

## [2.2.1] - 2025-01-XX

### Fixed - Signal-Based Dynamic Allocation ðŸŽ¯

**Fixed issue where strong signals couldn't get sufficient balance allocation**

#### Problem
- Bot detected strong signals (strength >= 70) but had insufficient balance to trade
- Example: "Pair BBUSDTM has strong signal (strength: 75) but insufficient balance ($0.26)"
- Allocation boost mechanism was too conservative to redistribute funds effectively

#### Fixed
- **Signal strength-based targeting**: Strong signals (>=70) now target 15% allocation (was 10%)
- **More aggressive redistribution**: Can take up to 50% from idle pairs, 30% from active pairs (was 20%)
- **Lower minimum reserves**: Pairs can be reduced to 5% minimum (was 10%)
- **Position-aware redistribution**: Prioritizes taking from pairs without active positions
- **Bug fix**: Corrected indentation in `allocate_to_best_pair()` method

#### Impact
- Strong signals now get adequate capital to execute trades
- Better capital efficiency when high-confidence opportunities appear
- Protects pairs with active positions from excessive redistribution
- No configuration changes required - improvements work automatically

See `SIGNAL_ALLOCATION_FIX.md` for detailed explanation and examples.

### Major - Unified Bot with Smart Auto-Detection ðŸŽ¯

**The bot is now fully unified with intelligent feature detection!**

#### Changed
- **Merged bot.py and bot_enhanced.py**: Single bot file for all use cases
  - Automatically enables advanced features based on configuration
  - Gracefully handles missing advanced modules
  - Works for both simple and advanced trading setups
  - No need to choose between two different bot files anymore!

#### Added - Smart Auto-Detection in Config
- **Telegram Notifications**: Auto-enabled when both `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` and `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` are provided
- **Multi-Pair Trading**: Auto-enabled when multiple pairs are specified in `TRADING_PAIRS`
  - Automatically uses 'best' allocation strategy for multi-pair setups
- **Dynamic Leverage**: Auto-enabled when `ENABLE_DYNAMIC_LEVERAGE=auto` and leverage range differs from base
- **Feature Summary Method**: `Config.get_feature_summary()` shows enabled features at startup

#### Enhanced
- **bot.py**: Complete rewrite with smart feature detection
  - Supports both single-pair and multi-pair trading
  - Integrates ML signals, Telegram, web dashboard, and dynamic leverage
  - Shows enabled features on startup
  - Missing `calculate_win_rate()` method added
- **config.py**: Added intelligent auto-detection logic
  - Internal flags: `_telegram_configured`, `_is_multi_pair`, `_dynamic_leverage_configured`
  - Smart defaults based on configuration
  - Clear feature summary for logging

#### Updated Documentation

- **QUICKSTART.md**: Simplified to single bot.py entry point
- **IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md**: Updated migration guide and best practices
- **.env.example**: Added detailed comments explaining auto-detection

#### Removed
- **bot_enhanced.py**: Functionality merged into unified bot.py

#### Benefits
1. **Simpler**: Just one bot file to run
2. **Smarter**: Automatically detects what you want to use
3. **Flexible**: Works from basic to advanced configurations
4. **Clear**: Shows exactly which features are enabled
5. **Maintainable**: Single codebase instead of two
